Requires-Dist: tbb (==2019.*)

Enables composability of two or more multi-threaded modules by using Intel® Threading Building Blocks (Intel® TBB) library as the common work scheduler. Prevents performance degradation due to resource oversubscription without any source code change. Drop-in composable replacement for Python's Pool and ThreadPool. Switches MKL-accelerated numpy/scipy to use TBB instead of OpenMP.  Additional details can be found in our [SciPy 2018 conference proceedings] (http://conference.scipy.org/proceedings/scipy2018/pdfs/anton_malakhov.pdf). 

One of many Intel® accelerated Python packages and performance library runtimes available on [PyPI](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/installing-the-intel-distribution-for-python-and-intel-performance-libraries-with-pip-and), and as part of [Intel® Distribution for Python](https://software.intel.com/en-us/distribution-for-python).
